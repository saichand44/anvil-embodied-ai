"""dataset-viz: browse a converted LeRobot dataset with a Rerun-based viewer.

This module is a thin wrapper: no subprocess, no Docker, no vendored
frontend. It validates the dataset root with
`mcap_converter.viz.dataset_check.validate_dataset_root`, then either prints
the episode count (`--list-episodes`) or loads the requested episodes
(`--episodes`, defaulting to the first 10) into one Rerun viewer session,
each as an independent, switchable `rerun.RecordingStream` recording.

    # are still being logged races against the server replaying its
    # (evicting, shared, cross-recording) buffer to that newly-connecting
    # client -- waiting until loading is fully done before opening the
    # viewer avoided it entirely. Printing the URL only after the loop
    # below finishes makes that the natural default instead of relying on
    # the user to already know not to click early.
